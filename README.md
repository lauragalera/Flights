Final practice in C++ for the subject "Data structures and Algorithms", especially focused on structures (STL). It works with a big amount of data extracted of the page https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ It basically displays a menu with a few options to choose among them. For example, it shows the most used plane by a company or, given a subset of airports, it shows the date with more delays.\n

There is also a report explaining, for each case, the reason I picked up that structure. The comments on the code, the messages displayed, the instructions and the report are in Catalan.
